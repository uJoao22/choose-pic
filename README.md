# Choose pic
This is a program developed in C# Windows Form application mode. It when loaded displays an image configured in MainFormDesigner and allows you to choose a photo from your desktop files, if you don't choose anything and click on "cancel" it warns you of the error.

The main file where the codes are is <b><i>MainForm.cs</i></b>.
